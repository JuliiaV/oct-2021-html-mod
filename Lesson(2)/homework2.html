    <i>History</i>
</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    <strong>2005–2008: Beginnings</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Anderson (born 14 May 1981 in Manchester) and Hutchcraft (born 30 August 1986 in Richmond, North Yorkshire) met
    outside Manchester's 42nd Street nightclub in November 2005, standing by while their friends got involved in a
    fight. Too drunk to join in, they began discussing music instead; realising they had similar
    tastes, they decided to start a band.Over the next few months, they exchanged music and lyrics via e-mail, before
    forming Bureau in March 2006. They performed their first gig as a quintet in May at The Music Box in Manchester, and
    were shortly afterwards signed to independent record label High Voltage Sounds.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2009–2012: Happiness</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Now called Hurts, the duo recorded an amateur music video for a song called "<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonderful_Life_(Hurts_song)">Wonderful Life</a>", with a female dancer
    who had responded to an advert they placed in a post office in Manchester. After they uploaded the video to their
    YouTube channel on 21 April 2009, it quickly went viral and has since had over 38 million views. In July, the band
    was signed to Sony subsidiary RCA Records as well as RCA imprint Major Label Records, run by their old friend Biff
    Stannard.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2012–2015: Exile</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In September 2012, Hurts confirmed that recording of their next album was underway, with producer Jonas Quant.
    Their second studio album, Exile, was available on 11 March 2013. A video-teaser on iTunes contained a new track
    from Exile called "The Road", which was released on 14 December 2012 on YouTube. In autumn 2013 the video got a
    nomination for UK Music Video Awards as the Best Music Ad – TV or Online. An audio-only video of "The Road" was
    also uploaded.
</p>
<p>
    The lead single from the album, "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_(Hurts_song)">Miracle</a>",
    premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 4 January 2013. A music video directed by
    Chris Turner was uploaded to YouTube on 4 February, but was permanently removed shortly after. A second video was
    shot and appeared online on 28 February. The single reached number 23 in Germany and number 120 in the UK.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2015 – 2017: Surrender</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In May 2015, Hurts released a new single titled "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzE3kNUWA9s">Some Kind of
    Heaven</a>". The release was produced with long-term
    collaborator Jonas Quant. On 6 October 2015, Hurts released the music video for "Wish", directed by Bryan Adams.
    Surrender was released on 9 October 2015. At the end of the tour for the album, Hurts released a video for the song
    "Nothing Will be Bigger Than Us". The video consisted of live concert footage of the Surrender tour in Moscow
    and London.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2017–2018: Desire</strong>
</p>
<p>
    "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Ones_(Hurts_song)">Beautiful Ones</a>", the first single from
    Desire, was released on 21 April 2017, the one-year anniversary of the death
    of American musician Prince, whom Hurts have cited as an inspiration. The song is assumed to be inspired by the
    Prince song "The Beautiful Ones", from his 1984 breakthrough album Purple Rain. The video for the song was shot in
    Kiev and was also released on 21 April 2017. In the video, which plays out in reverse, Hutchcraft portrays a drag
    queen who is chased and beaten by a group of men after one of them mistakes him for a woman in a nightclub and
    subsequently feels that his masculinity has been insulted. On 1 September, the band released another single, "Ready
    to Go". The video was filmed in Horwich, Greater Manchester. On 22 September, a single titled "Hold On to Me" was
    released.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>2020–present: Faith</strong>
</p>
<p>
    In May 2020, Hurts blacked out their pictures on their social media profiles and posted links to a Telegram profile,
    on which they released puzzles leading to the release of a lyric video for "<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekRcuZVlvpU">Voices</a>", the first single from their
    upcoming fifth album. With lyrics inspired by "isolation, desperation, and mania", Hutchcraft said that "Voices"
    had become "oddly prescient" during the COVID-19 pandemic. On 24 June, they revealed that the upcoming album
    would be titled Faith and released its second single, "Suffer". On 16 July, they released a third single called
    "Redemption" and announced that the album would be released on 4 September
